What I do and there may be better ways..


create the user

useradd -d /home/user user

then as root run:
visudo

in the file you will see
root ALL=(ALL) ALL

add a line below that line that has
user ALL=(ALL) ALL

* replace "user" with the username you want.

then when you want to do some admin level work you would just use sudo before the command.

sudo /sbin/shutdown -r now
